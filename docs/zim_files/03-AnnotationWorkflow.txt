====== 03-AnnotationWorkflow ======
Angelegt Freitag 10 August 2018


===== 0 - Navigate to multiviewer folder =====

[ ] Todo


===== 1 - Synchronize the sequences at the front (right side) =====

1. navigate all angles to the front.
	a. The front is where you can see the whole body in the frame **for the frame90** angle.
2. For each sequence, find the frame that aligns with the others.
	a. Some characteristic points are:
		b. the moment the foot touches the ground and rotates (initial contact)
			**example from 001-bg-01**
			{{./initial_contact.gif}}
(Annotations: Frame1: in the air, frame2: on the ground, Frame3: in the air)
		d. the moment the foot lifts off the ground and moves horizontally. You can sometimes see a clear motion blur.

			(Annotations: Frame1: on the ground, Frame2: on the ground, Frame3: in the air)


===== 2 - Move all sequences to the back and check alignment =====

1. Press **w** to navigate all angles at the same time
2. Move the sequences to the back
3. Now check if alignment is still given.
	a. check again characteristic points
	b. If alignment is still good, mark the sequence in the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pfc_5C7yODQZeAREOOip-TS8heD62cz05zIMz4CdgiA/edit?usp=sharing|gsheet]] as
		1. **end-aligned** if you **did not** have to manually adjust the aligment
		2. **manually aligned** if you **had to** do manual adjustments of the aligment
	c. if alignment is not clear for one step, check one step before and after
		1. If alignment is still given for most of the steps, mark the sequence as **end-aligned** or **manually aligned** depending on what you did.
		2. if alignment is **not** given for most of the steps, drop the sequence and mark it as **dropped**
	d. Sometimes, it is only one angle that cannot be properly aligned. In that case you mark the angle with a **D** in the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pfc_5C7yODQZeAREOOip-TS8heD62cz05zIMz4CdgiA/edit?usp=sharing|gsh]][[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pfc_5C7yODQZeAREOOip-TS8heD62cz05zIMz4CdgiA/edit?usp=sharing|eet.]]
		a. If more than one angle cannot be aligned, mark all angles with **D**
4. Update the sequence status in the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pfc_5C7yODQZeAREOOip-TS8heD62cz05zIMz4CdgiA/edit?usp=sharing|gsh]][[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pfc_5C7yODQZeAREOOip-TS8heD62cz05zIMz4CdgiA/edit?usp=sharing|eet]]
5. If alignement is given, press **J** to save the alignment before continuing

===== 3 - Alignment is given, start annotating =====

1. Did you save the aligment by pressing **j **? If not, press **j** to save the aligment
2. Navigate all angles back to the front.
3. Press **L** to start annotating the left foot.
	a. navigate back until the **body is not entirely in the frame.** Mark this as NOT_IN_FRAME by pressing **N**
		**example from 001-bg-01-30:21**
		{{./NIF_beginning.gif}}
		(animated gif)
		
		The transiation is between frame 31 and 32 (very subjective here)
		{{./NIF_beginning_1.jpg}} {{./NIF_beginning_2.jpg}}

	b. mark the last frame with NOT_IN_FRAME (**n**) and the first one in frame with **a** for IN_THE_AIR or **g** for ON_THE_GROUND, depending on what is valid for the **left foot**
4. Continue through the sequence and always mark **the first and last frame** of the IN_THE_AIR phase or ON_THE_GROUND phase.
5. At the end of the sequence, mark **last in frame** and **NOT_IN_FRAME** (n)
	**example from 001-bg-01-89:93**

7. Now Press **R** to switch over to the right foot
	a. do the same thing
8. When you are done, Press **c** to save the annotations

===== 4 - Did you save the alignment and the annotation? =====

If not, press **c** to save the anntations and press **j ** to save the aligment.
